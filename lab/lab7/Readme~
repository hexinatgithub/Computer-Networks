Implement the various functions in the different directories.  The
app_{simple/stress}_{client/server}.c are provided to you to test.  
Some functions you have already implemented in previous labs, you can
either use your solution or the solution we provided you to fill these
functions in (if you're not very confident in your solution use the one
we gave you).  You should also make your IM client and server work over
your complete DartNet implementation as described on the Lab 7 page.


BUILDING AND RUNNING:

4 machines are used: bear, green, spruce, gile

Use make to compile. 
To run the application:
1, start the overlay processes:
	At each node, goto overlay directory: run ./overlay&
	The overlay processes on 4 nodes should be started within 1 min.
	wait until you see: waiting connection from network layer on all the nodes.
2. start the network processes: 
	At each node, goto network directory: run ./network&
	wait until you see: waiting for connection from SRT process on all the nodes.
3. start the transport processes and run the application:
	AT one node, goto server dicrectory: run ./app_simple_app or ./app_stress_app
	At another node, goto client directory: run ./app_simple_app or ./app_stress_app

To stop the program:
use kill -s 2 processID to kill the network processes and overlay processes

If the port numbers used by the program are used already, the program exits.
